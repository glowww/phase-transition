Random graph exercices can be found in program/c/ and program/d/ with instructions on how to use them in their respective manual.txt

To generate percolated graphs:

1.		Execute in the command line
		$ make
		This will compile and generate the executable necessary.

2.      To generate percolated graphs by node: $ ./program_a_nodes.exe
        To generate percolated graphs by edges: $ ./program_a_edges.exe
        To check if a given grid percolates by node: $ ./program_b_nodes.exe
        To check if a given grid percolates by edges: $ ./program_b_edges.exe
        To check if a percolated graph by node has a hamiltonian cycle: $ ./program_d_nodes.exe
        To check if a percolated graph by edges has a hamiltonian cycle: $ ./program_d_edges.exe

To generate the charts content of exercices B and D: $ ./program.exe
