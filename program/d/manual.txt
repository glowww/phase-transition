To generate random graphs and execute the percolation process defined as Hamiltonian cycle:

1.		Close out.txt and list.txt. Otherwise, the program won't be able to write on the files. Do not open during the execution.

2.		Execute in the command line
		$ make
		This will compile and generate the executable necessary.

3.1.	It is required to have the following Python packages beforehand:
			os, sys, time, networkx matplotlib.pyplot

3.2		Execute in the command line
		$ python d_Phase_transition_on_random_graphs.py 0.00 1.00 0.01 50 10
		Where:
			0.00 is the initial p, it has to be <= 1.0 and >= to 0.0
			1.00 is the ending p, it has to be between 0 and 1 and >= to initial p
			0.01 is the p increment, in has to be 0.X or 0.0X
			50 is the number of graphs per p that will be generated
			10 is the number of nodes per graph
		This script will call another Python script X_graph_generator.py which will generate
		the graphs and append all the adjacency lists into list.txt and write the variable p in out.txt.
		Then it will execute the corresponding X_program.exe wich will read said list.txt and write the resulting
		probability in out.txt

4		Open list.txt and out.txt
		In list.txt there will be every graph that has been generated in form of an adjancency list.
		In out.txt there will be 2 columns. The first one is the value of p and the second one the percentage of percolation.
